#+Title: A Simple S5 example
#+Babel: :results silent

* quick start
1. add the directory holding =org-export-as-s5.el= to your load path
2. require the =org-export-as-s5= library
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require 'org-export-as-s5)
   #+end_src
3. call =M-x org-export-as-s5=
4. open the resulting page in your browser

* what is S5
- [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/][S5]] is "A Simple Standards-Based Slide Show System".

- S5 allows writing of slide show presentations as /standards-based/
  HTML and turns the web browser into the display software.

* what is this
- A single function named =org-export-as-s5= which modifies Org-mode's
  existing html export to generate a valid S5 presentation.

- This implementation relies heavily on Pierre de Buyl's [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/33143/match=s5][very thorough
  instructions]] posted to the Org-mode mailing list.

* where's the code
- The code is available [[https://github.com/eschulte/org-S5/raw/master/org-export-as-s5.el][here]]

- Simply evaluate this code, or add it to your =.emacs=, then call
  =M-x org-export-as-s5= from within an Org-mode buffer. *Note*: the
  [[http://gitweb.adaptive.cs.unm.edu/org-S5.git/tree/HEAD:/ui][ui]] directory holding S5 support files must be located in the same
  directory as the exported html.

- Currently there are three themes which can be set with the
  following.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq org-s5-theme "railscast")   ; based off `color-theme-railscasts'
    (setq org-s5-theme "default")     ; the default S5 theme
    (setq org-s5-theme "i18n")        ; the i18n theme by the author of S5
  #+end_src

- This entire directory is available as a [[https://github.com/eschulte/org-S5][git repository]]
